# Nightly Benchmark Results — 2026-11-10

Captured on **2026-11-10** from commit [`684d9b4`](https://github.com/MichaelJFazio/dugite/commit/684d9b4) on `main` (GitHub Actions `ubuntu-latest`).

### Measurement environment

| | |
|---|---|
| Runner | GitHub Actions `ubuntu-latest` (shared, virtualised) |
| CPU | AMD EPYC 9V74 80-Core Processor |
| vCPUs | 4 |
| Memory | 15.6 GiB |
| Kernel | Linux 7.0.0-1017-azure |
| Toolchain | rustc 1.97.0 (2d8144b78 2026-07-07) |
| Build profile | `bench` (release + debug assertions off) |

> **Read absolute numbers with care.** These run on shared, virtualised GitHub-hosted runners whose CPU model is not pinned and whose neighbours are not controlled. Treat the figures as an order-of-magnitude regression tripwire, not as hardware benchmarks: a `change: ±x%` between two dates can reflect a different host class rather than a code change. Use the interactive trend lines below, where a real regression shows as a sustained step rather than a single-day spike.

> **Not measured here:** end-to-end sync throughput, mainnet-scale UTxO memory, and anything requiring a live network. Those are covered by the devnet-validate and soak rigs, not by Criterion.

> **Interactive reports**, including per-benchmark detail pages and historical trend lines, are published at <https://michaeljfazio.github.io/dugite/benchmarks/>. Each section below also links directly to its interactive report.

> The collapsed _Raw measurements_ blocks contain the filtered `cargo bench` output (cargo build chatter and ANSI escapes are stripped). Full unfiltered logs are uploaded as the `benchmark-results-250` workflow artifact.

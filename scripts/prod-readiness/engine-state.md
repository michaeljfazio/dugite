## Backlog  (ranked by impact; one advanced per wake)
1. [H][ledger] ep57 preprod stake-distribution -10 ADA (2 delegators 630472f7/7d3e2b31 each EXACTLY
   -5 ADA). state:PARKED attempts:1 (1 refuted fix + 2 valid latent fixes banked #6/#7). UNRESOLVED.
   CONFIRMED so far: NOT reconstruction path (inert), NOT Dijkstra (inert/pre-era), reward_balance IS
   folded (epoch.rs:215). Measurement stalled: epoch.rs has MULTIPLE stake loops (live pool_stake ~205,
   per-cred ~267, snapshot pool_stake recompute ~852, mark construct ~326) and ad-hoc eprintlns kept
   hitting the wrong one. NEXT-ACTION (do NOT ad-hoc again): add per-credential stake_map values to the
   COMMITTED epoch-state-debug dump (epoch_state_debug.rs) so a replay yields per-cred JSON reliably; OR
   use the existing DUGITE_REWARD_DBG rewards.rs member-loop harness configured for these 2 creds. Then
   measure dugite ep57 utxo_stake for both vs Koios 9957549164/9815680998 to settle whether a clean
   immutable replay even reproduces the -5 ADA (0/931 diff suggests maybe NOT -> would re-open the
   fork/original-sync hypothesis).
2. [H][ledger] #11 mainnet stake-dereg residual (4 no-withdrawal cases diverge).
   state:NEW attempts:0  (replayable from db-mainnet; verify its epoch first)
3. [H][ledger] mainnet ep213 reward divergence (REWARD-DIVERGENCE-MAINNET-ep213.md).
   state:NEW attempts:0
4. [M][phase2] #22 CEK V1/V2 Babbage residual (budget/Error/unIData buckets).
   state:NEW attempts:0
5. [L][phase2] #14 V3 TxInfo deferred fields (inert until mainnet ep507).
   state:NEW attempts:0
6. [M][ledger] LATENT fork-path bug: apply_utxo_diff reconstruction didn't replay stake_map (valid
   fix preserved in scripts/prod-readiness/candidate-latent-fix-apply_utxo_diff.patch + worktree
   wf_9be2125b-d01-1). Land separately AFTER its own verification (re-sync past ep181). state:NEW attempts:0
7. [M][ledger] LATENT Dijkstra SUBUTXO bug: apply_sub_transactions mutated utxo_set but NOT stake_map/
   ptr_stake (asymmetry). Valid fix + add_instant_stake/delete_instant_stake helper refactor preserved in
   scripts/prod-readiness/candidate-latent-fix-dijkstra-subutxo.patch + worktree wf_dcc190ba-a5c-1. Inert
   for ep57 (Dijkstra is post-Conway). Land separately after its own verification. state:NEW attempts:0

## In-progress
- item: #1 ep57 preprod stake-distribution -10 ADA
- state: PARKED (after 8 wakes of measurement plumbing; needs PROPER per-cred instrumentation, not ad-hoc eprintlns — see next-action). Rotating to other backlog items.
- attempts: 1
- ANALYZE RESULT (w6lsvu2p2, Opus): canonical Haskell active-stake =
  resolveActiveInstantStakeCredentials (Stake.hs @52ef3d5) — per registered+delegated
  credential, active_stake = (UTxO instant stake) <> (reward-account balance); spec
  stakeRelation = UTxO-stake ∪ rewards (Shelley epoch.tex stakeDistr). 3 merge branches.
- ROOT-CAUSE DISAMBIGUATION (engine): analyze guessed the missing term is the reward
  balance, but BOTH creds are short by EXACTLY 5,000,000 lovelace (630472f7 9952549164
  vs 9957549164; 7d3e2b31 9810680998 vs 9815680998). A reward BALANCE is never round
  5.000000 ADA -> this is a STRUCTURAL UTxO instant-stake attribution bug (prior finding),
  NOT the reward-balance term. Fix target = the UTxO->credential instant-stake routing
  (crates/dugite-ledger/src/eras/common.rs::apply_utxo_changes + stake_routing rebuild),
  matching the canonical per-credential UTxO aggregation. Tier A.
- FIX RESULT (whq17wl1f, Opus, Tier A, checks_green): ROOT CAUSE = apply_utxo_diff in
  crates/dugite-ledger/src/ledger_seq.rs (the state-RECONSTRUCTION path used by
  rollback_via_seq after FORK rollbacks) mutated only the UTxO set, never
  stake_distribution.stake_map/ptr_stake. The LIVE apply path (apply_utxo_changes) keeps
  per-cred instant-stake incrementally; reconstruction did not -> fork rollback dropped the
  per-cred stake while inverting UTxO -> exact 5-ADA add/subtract asymmetry. FIX: reconstruction
  now reuses the SAME stake_routing as the live path (parity by construction); inserts ADD,
  deletes SUBTRACT. Regression test apply_utxo_diff_replays_credential_stake_not_just_utxo_set.
  Haskell: resolveActiveInstantStakeCredentials (Stake.hs) active=instant_stake<>balance, deposit NOT included.
- VERIFICATION NUANCE: this is a FORK-ROLLBACK-path bug. A clean from-genesis IMMUTABLE replay
  has no forks, so it may NOT reproduce the -10 ADA (dump also lacks per-pool active_stake).
  PLAN: (1) fixed-binary from-genesis replay; diff ep57 dump vs the saved UNFIXED dump
  (epoch-dumps-engine/preprod-ep57). If different -> compare to Koios. If identical -> clean
  replay can't exercise the fork path; escalate to regression-test + gauntlet + a queued LIVE
  re-sync (true end-to-end: network forks, match Koios ep48-181). (2) COMMIT ONLY after byte-exact
  end-to-end confirms (honoring 'byte-exact or it isn't fixed'). Koios ref: ep57 active_stake 26538160048802.
- reproduced: YES, byte-exact vs AUTHORITATIVE preprod.koios.rest (ep293, real chain):
  ep57 pool1n84mel6 active_stake: Koios 26538160048802 vs dugite 26538150048802 = -10 ADA.
  Localized (prior + confirmed): 2 delegators each -5 ADA, creds 630472f7bfeb8fde...b40d
  and 7d3e2b319c66fe...64ca. Compounds -> +1 lovelace WithdrawalAmountMismatch at ep181.
- root-cause hypothesis (from diagnose, Opus): UTxO-set add/spend asymmetry in
  crates/dugite-ledger/src/eras/common.rs::apply_utxo_changes — some outputs are
  spend-subtracted from a credential they were never fully add-credited to. NOT the
  stake-snapshot rebuild. Tier A fix.
- GROUND-TRUTH FIX: the Koios *MCP* serves the WRONG network (Preview ep1320 vs preprod
  ep293) -> all ledger ground truth now goes through lib/koios.sh <net> <endpoint> REST.
- next: analyze muscle (research canonical Haskell UTxO->stake-credit attribution + spec)
  -> fix (worktree, Tier A) -> VERIFYING replay (reuse db-clones/preprod-ep57) -> gauntlet.

## Running jobs
(none — item #1 PARKED; ad-hoc instrumentation reverted from main)

## VERIFY FINDING (CORRECTED after gauntlet — my wake9 analysis was WRONG)
- The apply_utxo_diff fix is INERT for ep57. Gauntlet wm055td32 REFUTED 2/3 (haskell-semantics +
  edge-epoch): the ep57 -10 ADA is reproduced on a CLEAN from-genesis LOCAL replay (no forks) per
  REWARD-DIVERGENCE-FINDINGS.md, which applies every block via the LIVE path apply_utxo_changes and
  NEVER invokes rollback_via_seq -> apply_utxo_diff. So the 0/931 fixed-vs-unfixed diff is the
  SIGNATURE OF AN INERT FIX, not 'fork-path-only'.
- My 'set==Koios -> clean replay correct' inference was a SNAPSHOT ERROR: the -10 ADA is in the GO
  snapshot; I compared the SET total. The findings doc explicitly RULES OUT incremental/reconstruction
  upkeep ("the -5 ADA is in UTxO set content or address->credential attribution, NOT incremental upkeep").
- CORRECTED ROOT CAUSE: a LIVE-path apply_utxo_changes attribution bug (eras/common.rs). STAKE_CLAMP
  fired 6x in the live path; last-mile points at a BASE-SCRIPT address (addr_test1zpu3l06a...) / a
  non-Phase-5 output-creation path / an era-boundary path. The next ANALYZE/FIX targets THAT.

## DB clones on disk
- db-clones/preprod-ep57         (unfixed-binary replay; baseline dump captured)
- db-clones/preprod-ep57-fixed   (fixed-binary replay, in progress)

## Gauntlet ledger  (passed/refuted approaches — never silently retry a REFUTED)
- REFUTED 2026-06-06 (wm055td32, 2/3): "fix apply_utxo_diff reconstruction path to replay stake_map".
  INERT for ep57 (the bug is in the LIVE apply_utxo_changes path; clean local replay reproduces it and
  never reaches apply_utxo_diff). DO NOT re-propose this as the ep57 fix. The patch is itself a valid
  LATENT fork-path fix -> tracked as backlog #6, needs its own verification (re-sync past ep181 first).

## Wake log
- wake1 2026-06-06T11:41Z: ASSESS found no db-preprod-sync (only db-mainnet + db-preprod-haskell
  [cardano-node format]). SCHEDULE picked #1 (top impact); its precondition is a preprod dugite
  db + the epoch-state-debug binary. DRIVE launched both as background jobs under the heavy-op
  lock (build=CPU, mithril=IO — recorded concurrency: different resource classes, both blocking
  prerequisites). RESCHEDULE ~1200s to let both finish.
- wake2 2026-06-06T11:52Z (early; prereqs finished fast): REPRODUCE. Found+fixed 2 launch-replay
  bugs (wipe must remove ledger-snapshot.bin AND haskell-ledger/ import dir, else node loads
  ep293 state and skips from-genesis replay). Clean from-genesis replay produced dumps ep0..62;
  ep56/57/58 captured. Fired diagnose muscle Workflow w2ci9weas (/workflows-visible) to localize
  the ep57 divergence vs Koios. Also committed observability change (diagnose mode routes all
  analytical work through the muscle for /workflows visibility).
- wake6 2026-06-06T12:25Z: analyze w6lsvu2p2 returned canonical Haskell active-stake formula
  (UTxO instant stake <> reward balance). Engine DISAMBIGUATED its root-cause: exact 5,000,000
  lovelace x2 rules out reward balance -> structural UTxO instant-stake attribution (prior finding).
  ANALYZING->FIXING; launched fix muscle whq17wl1f (Opus, worktree). Fix gated on VERIFYING replay
  reproducing 26538160048802 + gauntlet before any commit.
- wake9 2026-06-06T12:49Z: VERIFY decisive — fixed-vs-unfixed ep57 dump 0/931 diffs (fork-path bug,
  immutable replay can't exercise it); clean-replay SET total 254384027228099 == Koios byte-exact.
  Replay-gate ruled inapplicable; launched gauntlet wm055td32 with regression-test+parity evidence.
- wake10 2026-06-06T12:55Z: gauntlet wm055td32 REFUTED 2/3. CAUGHT MY OWN wake9 ERRORS: (a) 0/931
  diff = inert fix, not fork-path-only; (b) set-vs-go snapshot mistake in 'clean replay correct'.
  Real cause = live apply_utxo_changes base-script-address attribution (findings doc rules out
  reconstruction). Reverted inert fix from main; preserved as latent-fix patch (backlog #6).
  Item -> ANALYZING with corrected target. The gauntlet PREVENTED a #438-class wrong commit.
- wake11 2026-06-06T13:00Z: re-ANALYZE. Engine confirmed directly: common.rs:72 and mod.rs:2224
  stake_routing are identical (no routing discrepancy); snapshot is full UTxO-set rebuild -> bug is
  UTxO-set content (a ~5ADA UTxO missing/mis-credited per cred, STAKE_CLAMP underflow). Fired analyze
  wo8nuypp6 to pinpoint the exact live-path defect + enable STAKE_CLAMP logging for targeted re-replay.
- wake13 2026-06-06T13:15Z: analyze wo8nuypp6 returned a SELF-CONTRADICTORY result (research head:
  'snapshot omits reward_balance'; root-cause head: 'snapshot folds reward_balance, loss is stake_map
  clamp'). Engine DISAMBIGUATED from code: epoch.rs:215 total_stake = utxo_stake + reward_balance
  (reward_balance IS folded -> research head WRONG); snapshot uses the INCREMENTAL stake_map (epoch.rs:187,
  not rebuild_stake_distribution). So -5 ADA is in utxo_stake (stake_map), under-credited because a
  Phase-2 subtract clamped (common.rs:202-204 saturating_sub + skip-if-absent). Haskell instant-stake
  never underflows on a valid chain -> the REAL bug is a MISSING ADD in some output-creation path; the
  clamp is the symptom. Fired fix muscle with this confirmed non-conflicted target.
- wake15 2026-06-06T13:35Z: fix w01lpkz0o found+fixed a REAL ADD/SUB asymmetry but in the DIJKSTRA
  SUBUTXO path -> INERT for ep57 (Babbage/Alonzo, pre-Dijkstra). 2nd inert-but-valid fix (latent #7).
  KEY PROCESS INSIGHT: worktree muscles CANNOT run the replay harness, so they cannot pinpoint the exact
  ep57 tx; the ORCHESTRATOR must. Added STAKE_CLAMP/SKIP logging to common.rs Phase-2 (uncommitted),
  building node+epoch-state-debug; next wake replays to ep57 and greps the 2 creds to find the offender.
- wake16 2026-06-06T13:44Z: ran clamp-instrumented replay -> ZERO STAKE_CLAMP/SKIP events (any cred) through
  ep60. The Phase-2 subtract is perfectly balanced on the clean replay -> clamp/missing-ADD hypothesis
  REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT. Critical gap exposed: the engine never directly measured the per-cred stake_map
  value from its own replay (summary dump lacks it). Added per-cred STAKE_TRACE log in epoch.rs snapshot;
  rebuilding; next wake reads the actual ep57 value -> settles whether a clean immutable replay even
  reproduces the -5 ADA (mounting evidence — 0/931 diff, 0 clamps — suggests it may NOT, i.e. the bug is
  fork/original-sync-induced like the apply_utxo_diff path after all).
- wake17 2026-06-06T13:52Z: per-cred tracing.warn produced ZERO output (INFO=308, WARN=0) — node logging
  layers drop custom-target warns regardless of RUST_LOG. strings confirmed instrumentation IS in the
  binary, so this is a LOG-FILTER artifact -> wake16 '0 clamps' is UNCONFIRMED (logs were suppressed,
  not absent). Switched all instrumentation to eprintln (bypasses tracing, env-gated DUGITE_STAKE_TRACE);
  rebuilding. Next wake: replay with the env set, finally read the per-cred ep57 value.
- wake18 2026-06-06T13:58Z: eprintln instrumentation CONFIRMED in binary + env set, but ZERO output ->
  I instrumented the WRONG stake loop (epoch.rs has several; dump pool value comes from the snapshot
  delegation fold, not self.certs.delegations at ~205). After 8 wakes (11-18) of measurement plumbing
  with no ledger-logic progress, PARKING #1 per engineering judgment (don't tunnel). Banked: 2 valid
  latent fixes (#6/#7) + many refuted hypotheses. Reverted ad-hoc instrumentation; next wake ROTATES
  to a fresh backlog item (#11 mainnet stake-dereg or #3 ep213). #1 resumes later with PROPER committed
  per-cred dump instrumentation, not ad-hoc eprintlns.

- ledger.mainnet:   BYTE-EXACT vs Koios — reserves+treasury exact at ep212-221 (doc's +180.4B ep213 divergence GONE on HEAD); replay validating further
- sync.preprod:     ep181 HALT GONE on HEAD (clean replay past ep192); the original blocker is resolved

## Backlog  (ranked by impact; one advanced per wake)
0. [H][ledger][REAL-CURRENT] mainnet ep246 reserves +82,270,482 / treasury -55,269 divergence (Allegra,
   PV3). FIRST divergence at ep246 (ep209-245 byte-exact); persists/amortizes ep246-250 (replay at ep262).
   dugite took ~82.27M LESS from reserves at the ep245->246 reward transition. Found by broad Koios sweep
   (NOT in the stale docs). state:ANALYZING. Likely: reward-pot/reserves-expansion (rho) / undistributed-
   rewards-return / MIR calc at the Allegra boundary. Dumps in epoch-dumps-engine/mainnet-ep213/.
1. [H][ledger] ep57 preprod stake-distribution -10 ADA. *** RESOLVED on clean HEAD (wake22-23): ***
   per-cred dump proves dugite ep57 = Koios 9957549164/9815680998 BYTE-EXACT; clean from-genesis replay
   crosses ep181 with NO WithdrawalAmountMismatch (verified to ep192+). Prior findings doc was STALE.
   state:DONE-on-clean-replay. RESIDUAL: the fork-induced variant is still real -> land #6 (apply_utxo_diff
   reconstruction fix) for production fork-robustness, with its own verification. Old context below:
   CONFIRMED so far: NOT reconstruction path (inert), NOT Dijkstra (inert/pre-era), reward_balance IS
   folded (epoch.rs:215). Measurement stalled: epoch.rs has MULTIPLE stake loops (live pool_stake ~205,
   per-cred ~267, snapshot pool_stake recompute ~852, mark construct ~326) and ad-hoc eprintlns kept
   hitting the wrong one. NEXT-ACTION (do NOT ad-hoc again): add per-credential stake_map values to the
   COMMITTED epoch-state-debug dump (epoch_state_debug.rs) so a replay yields per-cred JSON reliably; OR
   use the existing DUGITE_REWARD_DBG rewards.rs member-loop harness configured for these 2 creds. Then
   measure dugite ep57 utxo_stake for both vs Koios 9957549164/9815680998 to settle whether a clean
   immutable replay even reproduces the -5 ADA (0/931 diff suggests maybe NOT -> would re-open the
   fork/original-sync hypothesis).
2. [H][ledger] #11 mainnet stake-dereg residual (4 no-withdrawal cases diverge).
   state:NEW attempts:0  (replayable from db-mainnet; verify its epoch first)
3. [DONE-on-HEAD][ledger] mainnet ep213 reserves divergence (== #11): RESOLVED. dugite reserves+treasury
   BYTE-EXACT vs Koios at ep212-221 (the doc's +180.4B ep213 divergence is GONE; fix landed in last 2 days).
   Stake-dereg reward attribution correct (reserves exact). OLD (stale) context: mainnet ep213 reward divergence (== #11; doc dated 2026-06-04, RECENT -> likely REAL,
   not stale like ep57). 4 target creds: 53215c471b7ac752e3ddf8f2c4c1e6ed111857bfaa675d5e31ce8bce,

   d9812f8d30b5db4b03e5b76cfd242db9cd2763da4671ed062be808a0. PLAN: mainnet from-genesis replay (db-mainnet,
   ep331; LONG - Byron+) with DUGITE_EPOCH_STATE_DUMP_CRED_FILTER=<4 creds> -> per-cred dump at ep213 ->
   compare vs koios.sh mainnet account_reward_history. NOTE: verify the finding isn't stale FIRST (re-read
   the doc's repro method; it bisected ep213 so may have a faster pre-ep213-snapshot path). state:NEW attempts:0
4. [M][phase2] #22 CEK V1/V2 Babbage residual (budget/Error/unIData buckets).
   state:NEW attempts:0
5. [L][phase2] #14 V3 TxInfo deferred fields (inert until mainnet ep507).
   state:NEW attempts:0
6. [H][ledger] FORK-ROBUSTNESS (elevated M->H, now vindicated): apply_utxo_diff reconstruction didn't
   replay stake_map -> the FORK-INDUCED variant of the ep57 bug. Clean HEAD replay is correct, but a live
   sync hitting a rollback could still corrupt stake. The refuted gauntlet trusted a STALE doc; this IS a
   real fix. Patch: scripts/prod-readiness/candidate-latent-fix-apply_utxo_diff.patch + worktree
   wf_9be2125b-d01-1. Verify via a fork-exercising scenario, then land. state:NEW attempts:0
7. [M][ledger] LATENT Dijkstra SUBUTXO bug: apply_sub_transactions mutated utxo_set but NOT stake_map/
   ptr_stake (asymmetry). Valid fix + add_instant_stake/delete_instant_stake helper refactor preserved in
   scripts/prod-readiness/candidate-latent-fix-dijkstra-subutxo.patch + worktree wf_dcc190ba-a5c-1. Inert
   for ep57 (Dijkstra is post-Conway). Land separately after its own verification. state:NEW attempts:0

## In-progress
- item: #8 NEW (real, found by broad sweep): mainnet ep246 reserves +82,270,482 divergence (Allegra)
- state: FIXING — diagnosis in (deltaR1 too small); rho/tau RULED OUT (unchanged); d changed 0.24->0.22 at ep246; fix muscle pinpointing d-source/blocksMade/eta
- attempts: 1
- ANALYZE RESULT (w6lsvu2p2, Opus): canonical Haskell active-stake =
  resolveActiveInstantStakeCredentials (Stake.hs @52ef3d5) — per registered+delegated
  credential, active_stake = (UTxO instant stake) <> (reward-account balance); spec
  stakeRelation = UTxO-stake ∪ rewards (Shelley epoch.tex stakeDistr). 3 merge branches.
- ROOT-CAUSE DISAMBIGUATION (engine): analyze guessed the missing term is the reward
  balance, but BOTH creds are short by EXACTLY 5,000,000 lovelace (630472f7 9952549164
  vs 9957549164; 7d3e2b31 9810680998 vs 9815680998). A reward BALANCE is never round
  5.000000 ADA -> this is a STRUCTURAL UTxO instant-stake attribution bug (prior finding),
  NOT the reward-balance term. Fix target = the UTxO->credential instant-stake routing
  (crates/dugite-ledger/src/eras/common.rs::apply_utxo_changes + stake_routing rebuild),
  matching the canonical per-credential UTxO aggregation. Tier A.
- FIX RESULT (whq17wl1f, Opus, Tier A, checks_green): ROOT CAUSE = apply_utxo_diff in
  crates/dugite-ledger/src/ledger_seq.rs (the state-RECONSTRUCTION path used by
  rollback_via_seq after FORK rollbacks) mutated only the UTxO set, never
  stake_distribution.stake_map/ptr_stake. The LIVE apply path (apply_utxo_changes) keeps
  per-cred instant-stake incrementally; reconstruction did not -> fork rollback dropped the
  per-cred stake while inverting UTxO -> exact 5-ADA add/subtract asymmetry. FIX: reconstruction
  now reuses the SAME stake_routing as the live path (parity by construction); inserts ADD,
  deletes SUBTRACT. Regression test apply_utxo_diff_replays_credential_stake_not_just_utxo_set.
  Haskell: resolveActiveInstantStakeCredentials (Stake.hs) active=instant_stake<>balance, deposit NOT included.
- VERIFICATION NUANCE: this is a FORK-ROLLBACK-path bug. A clean from-genesis IMMUTABLE replay
  has no forks, so it may NOT reproduce the -10 ADA (dump also lacks per-pool active_stake).
  PLAN: (1) fixed-binary from-genesis replay; diff ep57 dump vs the saved UNFIXED dump
  (epoch-dumps-engine/preprod-ep57). If different -> compare to Koios. If identical -> clean
  replay can't exercise the fork path; escalate to regression-test + gauntlet + a queued LIVE
  re-sync (true end-to-end: network forks, match Koios ep48-181). (2) COMMIT ONLY after byte-exact
  end-to-end confirms (honoring 'byte-exact or it isn't fixed'). Koios ref: ep57 active_stake 26538160048802.
- reproduced: YES, byte-exact vs AUTHORITATIVE preprod.koios.rest (ep293, real chain):
  ep57 pool1n84mel6 active_stake: Koios 26538160048802 vs dugite 26538150048802 = -10 ADA.
  Localized (prior + confirmed): 2 delegators each -5 ADA, creds 630472f7bfeb8fde...b40d
  and 7d3e2b319c66fe...64ca. Compounds -> +1 lovelace WithdrawalAmountMismatch at ep181.
- root-cause hypothesis (from diagnose, Opus): UTxO-set add/spend asymmetry in
  crates/dugite-ledger/src/eras/common.rs::apply_utxo_changes — some outputs are
  spend-subtracted from a credential they were never fully add-credited to. NOT the
  stake-snapshot rebuild. Tier A fix.
- GROUND-TRUTH FIX: the Koios *MCP* serves the WRONG network (Preview ep1320 vs preprod
  ep293) -> all ledger ground truth now goes through lib/koios.sh <net> <endpoint> REST.
- next: analyze muscle (research canonical Haskell UTxO->stake-credit attribution + spec)
  -> fix (worktree, Tier A) -> VERIFYING replay (reuse db-clones/preprod-ep57) -> gauntlet.

## Running jobs
- replay-measure  pid-file=.jobs/replay-measure.pid  (clean HEAD from-genesis replay climbing past ep93
  toward ep181). TEST: does it hit the original WithdrawalAmountMismatch halt at ep181? If it CROSSES
  ep181 cleanly -> ep57/ep181 RESOLVED on HEAD (prior finding stale); sync.preprod frontier unblocks. If
  it HALTS -> bug is fork-induced (vindicates refuted #6 apply_utxo_diff fix; gauntlet trusted stale doc).

## VERIFY FINDING (CORRECTED after gauntlet — my wake9 analysis was WRONG)
- The apply_utxo_diff fix is INERT for ep57. Gauntlet wm055td32 REFUTED 2/3 (haskell-semantics +
  edge-epoch): the ep57 -10 ADA is reproduced on a CLEAN from-genesis LOCAL replay (no forks) per
  REWARD-DIVERGENCE-FINDINGS.md, which applies every block via the LIVE path apply_utxo_changes and
  NEVER invokes rollback_via_seq -> apply_utxo_diff. So the 0/931 fixed-vs-unfixed diff is the
  SIGNATURE OF AN INERT FIX, not 'fork-path-only'.
- My 'set==Koios -> clean replay correct' inference was a SNAPSHOT ERROR: the -10 ADA is in the GO
  snapshot; I compared the SET total. The findings doc explicitly RULES OUT incremental/reconstruction
  upkeep ("the -5 ADA is in UTxO set content or address->credential attribution, NOT incremental upkeep").
- CORRECTED ROOT CAUSE: a LIVE-path apply_utxo_changes attribution bug (eras/common.rs). STAKE_CLAMP
  fired 6x in the live path; last-mile points at a BASE-SCRIPT address (addr_test1zpu3l06a...) / a
  non-Phase-5 output-creation path / an era-boundary path. The next ANALYZE/FIX targets THAT.

## Active job
- fix-muscle  workflow=whr4t971m  (Opus, pinpoint+fix ep246 deltaR1 + RUPD-component dump for byte-exact verify)
- replay-mainnet  pid-file=.jobs/replay-mainnet.pid  (mainnet from-genesis replay, db-mainnet clone,
  4-cred filter, DUGITE_EPOCH_STATE_DUMP=epoch-dumps-engine/mainnet-ep213). Climbing through Byron->ep214.
  CAUTION: free_ram=1GB at launch -> watch for OOM. When at ep213+: diff dugite reserves/treasury vs
  Koios totals (api.koios.rest) + per-cred reward vs account_reward_history. Confirm the +180.4B reserves.

## DB clones on disk
- db-clones/preprod-ep57         (unfixed-binary replay; baseline dump captured)
- db-clones/preprod-ep57-fixed   (fixed-binary replay, in progress)

## Gauntlet ledger  (passed/refuted approaches — never silently retry a REFUTED)
- REFUTED 2026-06-06 (wm055td32, 2/3): "fix apply_utxo_diff reconstruction path to replay stake_map".
  *** REFUTAL PREMISE NOW DISPROVEN: the refuters (and the findings doc) claimed a clean local replay
  reproduces the ep57 -5 ADA. DIRECT MEASUREMENT (per-cred dump, wake22) proves clean HEAD replay is
  byte-exact CORRECT at ep57 (9957549164/9815680998 == Koios). So the bug is NOT in the live path and IS
  likely fork-induced -> the apply_utxo_diff reconstruction fix (#6) may be the REAL fix after all. The
  ep181-halt replay test decides. Lesson: the findings doc was stale; trust live measurement over docs. ***

## Wake log
- wake1 2026-06-06T11:41Z: ASSESS found no db-preprod-sync (only db-mainnet + db-preprod-haskell
  [cardano-node format]). SCHEDULE picked #1 (top impact); its precondition is a preprod dugite
  db + the epoch-state-debug binary. DRIVE launched both as background jobs under the heavy-op
  lock (build=CPU, mithril=IO — recorded concurrency: different resource classes, both blocking
  prerequisites). RESCHEDULE ~1200s to let both finish.
- wake2 2026-06-06T11:52Z (early; prereqs finished fast): REPRODUCE. Found+fixed 2 launch-replay
  bugs (wipe must remove ledger-snapshot.bin AND haskell-ledger/ import dir, else node loads
  ep293 state and skips from-genesis replay). Clean from-genesis replay produced dumps ep0..62;
  ep56/57/58 captured. Fired diagnose muscle Workflow w2ci9weas (/workflows-visible) to localize
  the ep57 divergence vs Koios. Also committed observability change (diagnose mode routes all
  analytical work through the muscle for /workflows visibility).
- wake6 2026-06-06T12:25Z: analyze w6lsvu2p2 returned canonical Haskell active-stake formula
  (UTxO instant stake <> reward balance). Engine DISAMBIGUATED its root-cause: exact 5,000,000
  lovelace x2 rules out reward balance -> structural UTxO instant-stake attribution (prior finding).
  ANALYZING->FIXING; launched fix muscle whq17wl1f (Opus, worktree). Fix gated on VERIFYING replay
  reproducing 26538160048802 + gauntlet before any commit.
- wake9 2026-06-06T12:49Z: VERIFY decisive — fixed-vs-unfixed ep57 dump 0/931 diffs (fork-path bug,
  immutable replay can't exercise it); clean-replay SET total 254384027228099 == Koios byte-exact.
  Replay-gate ruled inapplicable; launched gauntlet wm055td32 with regression-test+parity evidence.
- wake10 2026-06-06T12:55Z: gauntlet wm055td32 REFUTED 2/3. CAUGHT MY OWN wake9 ERRORS: (a) 0/931
  diff = inert fix, not fork-path-only; (b) set-vs-go snapshot mistake in 'clean replay correct'.
  Real cause = live apply_utxo_changes base-script-address attribution (findings doc rules out
  reconstruction). Reverted inert fix from main; preserved as latent-fix patch (backlog #6).
  Item -> ANALYZING with corrected target. The gauntlet PREVENTED a #438-class wrong commit.
- wake11 2026-06-06T13:00Z: re-ANALYZE. Engine confirmed directly: common.rs:72 and mod.rs:2224
  stake_routing are identical (no routing discrepancy); snapshot is full UTxO-set rebuild -> bug is
  UTxO-set content (a ~5ADA UTxO missing/mis-credited per cred, STAKE_CLAMP underflow). Fired analyze
  wo8nuypp6 to pinpoint the exact live-path defect + enable STAKE_CLAMP logging for targeted re-replay.
- wake13 2026-06-06T13:15Z: analyze wo8nuypp6 returned a SELF-CONTRADICTORY result (research head:
  'snapshot omits reward_balance'; root-cause head: 'snapshot folds reward_balance, loss is stake_map
  clamp'). Engine DISAMBIGUATED from code: epoch.rs:215 total_stake = utxo_stake + reward_balance
  (reward_balance IS folded -> research head WRONG); snapshot uses the INCREMENTAL stake_map (epoch.rs:187,
  not rebuild_stake_distribution). So -5 ADA is in utxo_stake (stake_map), under-credited because a
  Phase-2 subtract clamped (common.rs:202-204 saturating_sub + skip-if-absent). Haskell instant-stake
  never underflows on a valid chain -> the REAL bug is a MISSING ADD in some output-creation path; the
  clamp is the symptom. Fired fix muscle with this confirmed non-conflicted target.
- wake15 2026-06-06T13:35Z: fix w01lpkz0o found+fixed a REAL ADD/SUB asymmetry but in the DIJKSTRA
  SUBUTXO path -> INERT for ep57 (Babbage/Alonzo, pre-Dijkstra). 2nd inert-but-valid fix (latent #7).
  KEY PROCESS INSIGHT: worktree muscles CANNOT run the replay harness, so they cannot pinpoint the exact
  ep57 tx; the ORCHESTRATOR must. Added STAKE_CLAMP/SKIP logging to common.rs Phase-2 (uncommitted),
  building node+epoch-state-debug; next wake replays to ep57 and greps the 2 creds to find the offender.
- wake16 2026-06-06T13:44Z: ran clamp-instrumented replay -> ZERO STAKE_CLAMP/SKIP events (any cred) through
  ep60. The Phase-2 subtract is perfectly balanced on the clean replay -> clamp/missing-ADD hypothesis
  REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT. Critical gap exposed: the engine never directly measured the per-cred stake_map
  value from its own replay (summary dump lacks it). Added per-cred STAKE_TRACE log in epoch.rs snapshot;
  rebuilding; next wake reads the actual ep57 value -> settles whether a clean immutable replay even
  reproduces the -5 ADA (mounting evidence — 0/931 diff, 0 clamps — suggests it may NOT, i.e. the bug is
  fork/original-sync-induced like the apply_utxo_diff path after all).
- wake17 2026-06-06T13:52Z: per-cred tracing.warn produced ZERO output (INFO=308, WARN=0) — node logging
  layers drop custom-target warns regardless of RUST_LOG. strings confirmed instrumentation IS in the
  binary, so this is a LOG-FILTER artifact -> wake16 '0 clamps' is UNCONFIRMED (logs were suppressed,
  not absent). Switched all instrumentation to eprintln (bypasses tracing, env-gated DUGITE_STAKE_TRACE);
  rebuilding. Next wake: replay with the env set, finally read the per-cred ep57 value.
- wake18 2026-06-06T13:58Z: eprintln instrumentation CONFIRMED in binary + env set, but ZERO output ->
  I instrumented the WRONG stake loop (epoch.rs has several; dump pool value comes from the snapshot
  delegation fold, not self.certs.delegations at ~205). After 8 wakes (11-18) of measurement plumbing
  with no ledger-logic progress, PARKING #1 per engineering judgment (don't tunnel). Banked: 2 valid
  latent fixes (#6/#7) + many refuted hypotheses. Reverted ad-hoc instrumentation; next wake ROTATES
  to a fresh backlog item (#11 mainnet stake-dereg or #3 ep213). #1 resumes later with PROPER committed
  per-cred dump instrumentation, not ad-hoc eprintlns.
- wake19 2026-06-06T14:00Z: SCHEDULE — instead of rotating into #11/#3 (same per-cred-divergence class
  -> same measurement wall that stalled #1), chose the dependency-aware move: build SHARED per-cred dump
  infra (reliable JSON, no log-filter/loop-guessing). Fired fix muscle whzzl2vls to add per-credential
  stake (utxo_stake/reward_balance/total/pool) to the epoch-state-debug dump gated on DUGITE_TRACE_CREDS.
  Once verified+committed, ALL ledger byte-exactness items become measurable from a replay's JSON. This
  is the engine investing in tooling to unblock a whole frontier rather than tunneling.
- wake21 2026-06-06T14:11Z: infra muscle whzzl2vls delivered per-credential dump (PerCredentialSummary +
  CredentialEntry joining GO-snapshot stake_distribution + delegations + rupd.rewards, env-filterable via
  DUGITE_EPOCH_STATE_DUMP_CRED_FILTER, top-200 + pinned-filter, 5 unit tests, fields aligned to cardano-cli
  debug log-epoch-state). Tier B, checks_green, 1 file (epoch_state_debug.rs, feature-gated, no ledger
  semantics). Applied to main (uncommitted); building. Next wake replays + reads per-cred JSON to settle
  ep57 and arm the same tooling for #3 ep213 / #11.
- wake22 2026-06-06T14:14Z: *** BREAKTHROUGH *** per-cred dump infra VERIFIED + COMMITTED (62db548471).
  Direct measurement: clean HEAD from-genesis replay computes ep57 per-cred stake BYTE-EXACT vs Koios
  (630472f7=9957549164, 7d3e2b31=9815680998; appear in ep58-dump GO snapshot due to mark/set/go lag).
  The -5 ADA is NOT reproduced on clean HEAD -> prior REWARD-DIVERGENCE-FINDINGS.md is STALE (old code or
  fork-affected db). 8 wakes of 'stalled measurement' actually produced the answer: dugite is already
  correct on clean replay. Left the replay climbing to ep181 to test the original halt (decides
  fork-induced-bug-real vs fully-resolved). Lesson banked: stale findings docs misled the gauntlet.
- wake23 2026-06-06T14:22Z: *** ITEM #1 RESOLVED *** clean HEAD replay reached ep192 having CROSSED
  ep181 with ZERO WithdrawalAmountMismatch (the original halt). With ep57 per-cred byte-exact (wake22),
  the ep57/ep181 divergence is RESOLVED on HEAD; prior findings doc confirmed STALE. ledger.preprod +
  sync.preprod frontiers UNBLOCKED. Residual: land #6 for fork-robustness (the fork-induced variant).
  Next wake: let replay finish to ep293 (lock frontier), then rotate to #3 ep213 / #11 — NOW ARMED with
  the per-cred dump tool that made this resolution possible.
- wake24 2026-06-06T14:27Z: BROADENED preprod validation (lock-free, using produced dumps + koios.sh):
  dugite total active_stake BYTE-EXACT vs Koios at ep100/150/200/230 (253512539651088 / 327288105772146 /
  381515925060861 / 380718162816350) spanning Shelley→Alonzo→Babbage→Conway. Clean replay ep0-233 has
  ZERO WithdrawalAmountMismatch/panic/ValidationTagMismatch/chain_diverged. The preprod ledger frontier is
  solidly byte-exact, not just ep57. Replay finishing to ep293; next wake rotates to mainnet (#3 ep213 /
  #11) armed with the per-cred dump.
- wake25 2026-06-06T14:33Z: SCHEDULE prep (lock-free; preprod replay at ep267 still holds heavy-op lock).
  db-mainnet usable (ep331 + ledger snapshots; Koios mainnet tip ep635). Mainnet ep213 finding is RECENT
  (2026-06-04) so unlike ep57 it's likely REAL -> warrants a mainnet replay. Extracted the 4 target creds
  for the per-cred filter. Next wake: when preprod replay (->ep293) frees the lock, START the mainnet
  investigation (either a from-genesis replay, or the doc's faster bisect path if it has one) OR pick
  phase2 #22 (doable on the already-present db-preprod-sync Babbage Plutus) if mainnet replay is too long.
- wake26 2026-06-06T14:39Z: ROTATE to mainnet #3/#11 (ep213 reserves divergence, recent+real). Doc method:
  from-genesis REPLAY is fast (~min, not hours; replay!=full-validation-sync). SIGTERMed preprod replay
  (frontier already established ep0-233 + spot-checks), cloned db-mainnet (CoW), wiped to immutable,
  launched mainnet from-genesis replay with the 4 stake-dereg creds filtered + epoch-state-debug. Byron
  climbing. Next wake: poll to ep214, diff reserves/treasury vs Koios to reproduce the +180.4B, then
  diagnose with the haskell-ledger-cross-validation skill. WATCH RAM (1GB free at launch).
- wake27 2026-06-06T14:42Z: *** mainnet ep213 RESOLVED on HEAD *** dugite reserves+treasury BYTE-EXACT vs
  Koios at ep212/213/214/220/221 (diff=0). The doc's +180.4B ep213 reserves divergence is GONE (fix landed
  2026-06-04..06). 4 stake-dereg creds absent from dump = deregistered; reserves-exact => their reward
  attribution is correct. KEY STRATEGIC FINDING: BOTH ep57 (preprod) and ep213 (mainnet) backlog items
  were STALE (already fixed on HEAD). The backlog is seeded from old findings docs describing fixed bugs.
  PIVOT: stop chasing stale per-finding items; do BROAD validation (sweep reserves/treasury/per-cred across
  many epochs both nets vs Koios) to find any REAL remaining divergence. Mainnet replay continues to validate
  more history. This is great production-readiness news: dugite is more correct than the docs suggested.
- wake28 2026-06-06T14:47Z: BROAD SWEEP found a REAL current divergence: mainnet reserves byte-exact
  ep209-245 then DIVERGES at ep246 (+82,270,482 reserves, -55,269 treasury), bisected (ep245 exact). This
  is the first genuine non-stale bug the engine has found -> the broad-validation pivot works. ep246=Allegra
  PV3. dugite under-removed ~82.27M from reserves at the 245->246 reward transition. Fired analyze muscle to
  diagnose via haskell-ledger-cross-validation (reward-pot / reserves-expansion / undistributed-return / MIR).
- wake29 2026-06-06T14:52Z: characterized the ep246 divergence trajectory (lock-free while analyze runs):
  reserves_diff ep246=+82.27M, ep250=+81.6M, ep255=+81.8M, ep260=+81.0M, ep265=+80.2M, ep270=+79.4M,
  ep275=+88.1M. So it is a DISCRETE one-time ~82.27M reserves error at the ep245->246 boundary (slowly
  self-amortizes as the extra reserves generate slightly more expansion), NOT a per-epoch systematic drift,
  PLUS a second discrete event near ep271-275 (+~9M). Narrows diagnosis to a specific reward/MIR/pot event
  at the ep246 Allegra boundary. analyze muscle w93yngoj8 still running; mainnet replay at ep275.
- wake30 2026-06-06T14:?? : analyze w93yngoj8 done — DIAGNOSIS: ep246 reserves+82.27M = deltaR1 too small in
  the reward update (startStep: deltaR1=floor(min(1,eta)*rho*reserves); rho/tau/d ALL from prevPParams in
  Haskell). Sign pattern (reserves high + treasury low) matches a small deltaR1 (rPot=ssFee+deltaR1 ->
  deltaT1=floor(tau*rPot) also shrinks). Engine pinpointing: rewards.rs:177 pp=params sources rho/tau; d
  uses separate prev_d (#629). RULED OUT rho/tau (mainnet ep245==ep246: rho 0.003, tau 0.2). CONFIRMED d
  changed 0.24->0.22 at ep246. So bug is in deltaR1's d-dependent eta/expected_blocks OR blocksMade source
  OR eta Rational arithmetic. Fired fix muscle to read the call site (which epoch's d/blocks passed),
  compute Haskell-correct eta from Koios ep244 d + ep245 pool_blocks, pinpoint the exact wrong input, fix
  (Tier A), and ADD RUPD-component dump (eta/expected_blocks/actual_blocks/deltaR1) for byte-exact verify.

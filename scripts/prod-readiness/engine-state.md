## In-progress
- item: #1 ep57 preprod stake-distribution -10 ADA
- state: GAUNTLET (replay-gate proven inapplicable; regression-test+parity evidence; gauntlet running; fix UNCOMMITTED)
- attempts: 1
- ANALYZE RESULT (w6lsvu2p2, Opus): canonical Haskell active-stake =
  resolveActiveInstantStakeCredentials (Stake.hs @52ef3d5) — per registered+delegated
  credential, active_stake = (UTxO instant stake) <> (reward-account balance); spec
  stakeRelation = UTxO-stake ∪ rewards (Shelley epoch.tex stakeDistr). 3 merge branches.
- ROOT-CAUSE DISAMBIGUATION (engine): analyze guessed the missing term is the reward
  balance, but BOTH creds are short by EXACTLY 5,000,000 lovelace (630472f7 9952549164
  vs 9957549164; 7d3e2b31 9810680998 vs 9815680998). A reward BALANCE is never round
  5.000000 ADA -> this is a STRUCTURAL UTxO instant-stake attribution bug (prior finding),
  NOT the reward-balance term. Fix target = the UTxO->credential instant-stake routing
  (crates/dugite-ledger/src/eras/common.rs::apply_utxo_changes + stake_routing rebuild),
  matching the canonical per-credential UTxO aggregation. Tier A.
- FIX RESULT (whq17wl1f, Opus, Tier A, checks_green): ROOT CAUSE = apply_utxo_diff in
  crates/dugite-ledger/src/ledger_seq.rs (the state-RECONSTRUCTION path used by
  rollback_via_seq after FORK rollbacks) mutated only the UTxO set, never
  stake_distribution.stake_map/ptr_stake. The LIVE apply path (apply_utxo_changes) keeps
  per-cred instant-stake incrementally; reconstruction did not -> fork rollback dropped the
  per-cred stake while inverting UTxO -> exact 5-ADA add/subtract asymmetry. FIX: reconstruction
  now reuses the SAME stake_routing as the live path (parity by construction); inserts ADD,
  deletes SUBTRACT. Regression test apply_utxo_diff_replays_credential_stake_not_just_utxo_set.
  Haskell: resolveActiveInstantStakeCredentials (Stake.hs) active=instant_stake<>balance, deposit NOT included.
- VERIFICATION NUANCE: this is a FORK-ROLLBACK-path bug. A clean from-genesis IMMUTABLE replay
  has no forks, so it may NOT reproduce the -10 ADA (dump also lacks per-pool active_stake).
  PLAN: (1) fixed-binary from-genesis replay; diff ep57 dump vs the saved UNFIXED dump
  (epoch-dumps-engine/preprod-ep57). If different -> compare to Koios. If identical -> clean
  replay can't exercise the fork path; escalate to regression-test + gauntlet + a queued LIVE
  re-sync (true end-to-end: network forks, match Koios ep48-181). (2) COMMIT ONLY after byte-exact
  end-to-end confirms (honoring 'byte-exact or it isn't fixed'). Koios ref: ep57 active_stake 26538160048802.
- reproduced: YES, byte-exact vs AUTHORITATIVE preprod.koios.rest (ep293, real chain):
  ep57 pool1n84mel6 active_stake: Koios 26538160048802 vs dugite 26538150048802 = -10 ADA.
  Localized (prior + confirmed): 2 delegators each -5 ADA, creds 630472f7bfeb8fde...b40d
  and 7d3e2b319c66fe...64ca. Compounds -> +1 lovelace WithdrawalAmountMismatch at ep181.
- root-cause hypothesis (from diagnose, Opus): UTxO-set add/spend asymmetry in
  crates/dugite-ledger/src/eras/common.rs::apply_utxo_changes — some outputs are
  spend-subtracted from a credential they were never fully add-credited to. NOT the
  stake-snapshot rebuild. Tier A fix.
- GROUND-TRUTH FIX: the Koios *MCP* serves the WRONG network (Preview ep1320 vs preprod
  ep293) -> all ledger ground truth now goes through lib/koios.sh <net> <endpoint> REST.
- next: analyze muscle (research canonical Haskell UTxO->stake-credit attribution + spec)
  -> fix (worktree, Tier A) -> VERIFYING replay (reuse db-clones/preprod-ep57) -> gauntlet.

## Running jobs
- gauntlet-muscle  workflow=wm055td32  (3 Opus refuters on the ep57 fix). Fix (2 files) applied to MAIN working
  tree UNCOMMITTED, pending gauntlet pass.

## VERIFY FINDING (decisive)
- Fixed-vs-unfixed from-genesis ep57 dump diff = 0/931 fields -> a clean IMMUTABLE replay never
  invokes the fork-rollback reconstruction path, so it neither reproduces the bug nor reflects the
  fix. The "immutable replay reproduces Koios" gate is STRUCTURALLY INAPPLICABLE to this fork-path bug.
- Clean-replay ep57 SET total_active_stake 254384027228099 == Koios epoch_info.active_stake BYTE-EXACT
  -> clean replay is correct (no -10 ADA), confirming the bug is fork-rollback-only.
- Therefore verification = regression test (deterministic fork-rollback reproduction, passes) +
  parity-by-construction (reconstruction reuses the known-correct live stake_routing) + Haskell match
  + adversarial gauntlet. End-to-end tripwire: a LIVE from-genesis re-sync must reach PAST ep181
  (original WithdrawalAmountMismatch halt) without halting (queued, post-commit continuous check).

## DB clones on disk
- db-clones/preprod-ep57         (unfixed-binary replay; baseline dump captured)
- db-clones/preprod-ep57-fixed   (fixed-binary replay, in progress)

## Wake log
- wake1 2026-06-06T11:41Z: ASSESS found no db-preprod-sync (only db-mainnet + db-preprod-haskell
  [cardano-node format]). SCHEDULE picked #1 (top impact); its precondition is a preprod dugite
  db + the epoch-state-debug binary. DRIVE launched both as background jobs under the heavy-op
  lock (build=CPU, mithril=IO — recorded concurrency: different resource classes, both blocking
  prerequisites). RESCHEDULE ~1200s to let both finish.
- wake2 2026-06-06T11:52Z (early; prereqs finished fast): REPRODUCE. Found+fixed 2 launch-replay
  bugs (wipe must remove ledger-snapshot.bin AND haskell-ledger/ import dir, else node loads
  ep293 state and skips from-genesis replay). Clean from-genesis replay produced dumps ep0..62;
  ep56/57/58 captured. Fired diagnose muscle Workflow w2ci9weas (/workflows-visible) to localize
  the ep57 divergence vs Koios. Also committed observability change (diagnose mode routes all
  analytical work through the muscle for /workflows visibility).
- wake6 2026-06-06T12:25Z: analyze w6lsvu2p2 returned canonical Haskell active-stake formula
  (UTxO instant stake <> reward balance). Engine DISAMBIGUATED its root-cause: exact 5,000,000
  lovelace x2 rules out reward balance -> structural UTxO instant-stake attribution (prior finding).
  ANALYZING->FIXING; launched fix muscle whq17wl1f (Opus, worktree). Fix gated on VERIFYING replay
  reproducing 26538160048802 + gauntlet before any commit.
- wake9 2026-06-06T12:49Z: VERIFY decisive — fixed-vs-unfixed ep57 dump 0/931 diffs (fork-path bug,
  immutable replay can't exercise it); clean-replay SET total 254384027228099 == Koios byte-exact.
  Replay-gate ruled inapplicable; launched gauntlet wm055td32 with regression-test+parity evidence.
